# nextjs-firebase-redux-starter

Its starter kit for nextjs which uses redux , redux-persist,firebase auth, tailwind css,next-redux-wrapper.

It was frustrating setting everything up while working on [loggernow.com](https://www.loggernow.com/) so decided to make this public.\
In the hope of there will be another  soul facing the same problem as me  😃.
